  <summary>Washington, DC is the ancestral territory of the Nacotchtank (Anacostan) and Piscataway peoples.</summary> 
I am writing this from Washington DC, which occupies what was was and still is the ancestral lands of the Nacotchtank (or Anacostan) and Piscataway people. Corn, beans, and squash once grew on Capitol Hill. Pottery has been unearthed on the site of what is now the White House, and burial mounds have been uncovered at Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling. Today there are roughly 4,000 Indiginous citizens of the District of Columbia, representing not only local tribal communities but also ones from all across the Americas. 

To learn more about the Nacotchtank and learn about efforts to gain recognition for the Nacotchtank history of the area, please visit the DC Native History Project at onceasitwasdc.org.

### HELLO

I love a good personal project, the less useful the better. Measuring sandwiches, and mapping newspaper football coverage, it’s a wonderful waste of time. 

The abstract I submitted to the conference has some langauge about invisible maps. That's more or less accurate, but I really just started particular project because I couldn’t go to the studio where I take drum lessons and practice during pre-vaccine days of the pandemic, and I wanted to still make things with music even though I wasn’t really able to make music. This talk...you aren’t going to understand music in a different way or whatever. I just like to take information and make it do things it isn’t designed to do. And music information is a fun for for this, because it can go in so many different ways. 

### What's out there?

Obviously the first thing to do is see what else is out there, what already exists. What I found tended to fit into one of three categories:

>1 Maps of Where Music Is: Maps of where to find certain types of music, like this one published by Standard Oil in 1949 as part of their weekly educational radio program to promote music appreciation in children.

>2 Maps of Music "Networks":

>3 Maps Inspired by Music: Like Travis White’s Cartographic Pleasures: Maps Inspired by Joy Division’s Unknown Pleasures Album Art,

It's sort of difficult to find maps of the music itself. If I had to guess why, I'd say that it's because music is something you hear, and it’s difficult to conceive of something so ephemeral as having a fixed location. You can map the origin, or how it relates to similar sounds, you can apply aspects of it to the physical earth, but what about mapping the sound itself? Maps are typically - not always, of course, please note Harrison Cole's talk later this session - but often visual aids. What do you see, what do you picture, when you listen to, or make, music? How can you visualize the experience of music? How can you map that? 

### Turning Music into Data ("Data")

I started logging music notes as data points during a session of Creative Carto last year. I didn't do anything with it, initially, until the 30 Day Map Challenge. The 30 Day Map Challenge is an absolutely unmatched opportunity to dive into your folder of halfbaked ideas and just let 'er rip. 

This non-map map just shows  how often each part of the kit is played during a given song - in this case, First Date, by blink-182.

[AR kit]

There is inherent spatiality to drumming. I think there are actually a fair amount of drummers in NACIS! I have done no research on the topic but I’d wager that there’s some solid overlap in cartographers and drummers.

And I bring that up now while  you are looking at Past NACIS president Anthony Robinson’s setup.  I show you this just because there are a lot of different ways to build a kit, including, like, endless cymbals, but for the purposes of this talk, we’re going to just go with the basics. So, to set the area that we will be mapping. 

[7DC kit]

This is the kit in the turquoise practice room at 7DrumCity, the kit I play on most often and the basis for the next few visuals. 

As for the data itself: I worked from written sheet music. If you can read regular sheet music, awesome! Throw it all out, because drum sheet music is different. There isn’t a scale, really. No chords, no octaves, the note placement just refers to the different drums. So here’s a little diagram of that. 

After some consideration I realized that the best way to make use of my short time with you all, with as little time explaining non-cartography topics as possible was to focus on one piece of classic , widely beloved, well known music with a memorable drum pattern
